# Salary Calculator

## Description

The application gathers information from employees, such as their names, ID numbers, job titles, and annual salaries. When an employee is added to the database, their information is displayed in a table on the browser. If an employee is removed, a "delete" button is available for each employee. The total monthly salary for all employees is also displayed on the browser, and if it exceeds $20,000, the background color of the total monthly cost will turn red.
