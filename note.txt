TODO: SETUP/GITHUB STUFF;
    - name repo: weekend-jquery-salary-calculator
    - commit regularity!


FINAL GOAL: 
    1. records employee salaries
    2. adds salaries up to report monthly costs 

TODO: FORM <form>;
    a. have an input to collect employee's:
        _ firstName
        _ lastName 
        _ idNumber 
        _ jobTitle
        _ annualSalary



    b. have button, type="submit" that:
        - collect employee's inputs
        - store the employee's inputs to calculate monthly costs ( eg. val() )
        - append information to the DOM ( eg. append() )
        - clear the input fields ( eg. empty() )

        - Using the stored information: calculate monthly costs 
        - and append 'this' (TotalMonthlyCost) to the to DOM.
             * IF the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000 == 'append' a red background color to the TotalMonthlyCost

    c. add DELETE button; (For Base mode, it does **not** need to remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.)
        - removes an employee from the DOM
        - once employee is removed their annualSalary too should be REMOVE from the TotalMonthlyCost

    d. STRETCH GOAL: Add styling or extra functionality that fits with the theme of this assignment.
        - DELETE button: 
            * update the _ TotalMonthlyCost _ section on the page to reflect the employee's removal.
                (_HINT:_ You will need to figure out which employee was removed, in order to subtract their salary from the total. 
                         Consider using `.text()` as a getter, or look into jQuery's `.data()` function. This is tricky! )




why is dynamic 'employee-table' and 'deletebtn' not displaying on the DOM? 
The issue is that the render() function is first emptying the #employee-table element, and then appending the new employee's data to it. Because of this, the new employee's data is not being displayed on the DOM.
SOLUTION:
You need to move the $('#employee-table').empty(); statement after the for loop, so that it clears the table only after all the new employee's data has been added.
